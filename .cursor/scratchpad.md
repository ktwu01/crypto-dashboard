# Project Plan: Crypto Analysis Dashboard

This document outlines the development plan for the Crypto Analysis Dashboard, based on initial ideas.

## Background and Motivation

The goal is to build a comprehensive crypto analysis dashboard. The initial version can fetch data, but we need to expand its capabilities to provide more immediate value to the user, introduce personalization, and leverage AI for unique insights.

The current implementation includes:
- Dashboard with Market Overview, Trending Coins, and Gainers/Losers features
- Markets view with comprehensive crypto table
- Portfolio management capabilities
- Bitcoin price charting with multiple timeframes
- Vite proxy configuration for CoinGecko API in development mode

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Critical Infrastructure Issues Identified (October 17, 2025)

1. **Unsafe Proxy Dependency** üî¥ ARCHITECTURAL FLAW
   - **Current Implementation**: App uses Vite dev proxy (`/api` -> `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3`)
   - **Problem**: Proxy only works in dev mode, creating environment-specific behavior
   - **Security Issue**: Vite's `server.proxy` is NOT meant for production (per Vite security best practices)
   - **Impact**: App works differently in dev vs prod, making it unreliable and unsafe
   - **Root Cause**: Architectural decision to rely on dev-only tooling

2. **Unsafe Data Access Patterns** üî¥ RUNTIME SAFETY
   - **Problem**: Multiple components call `.toFixed()` on potentially undefined values
   - **Impact**: When API calls fail or return unexpected data, the app crashes with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')"
   - **Locations Affected**:
     - `GainersLosers.tsx:42` - `coin.price_change_percentage_24h.toFixed(2)`
     - `MarketOverview.tsx` - Multiple stats using `.toFixed()` without null checks
     - Any component accessing nested API response properties

3. **No Environment Configuration** ‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION BLOCKER
   - **Problem**: API base URL is hardcoded in proxy config, not configurable
   - **Impact**: Cannot deploy to production or switch environments safely
   - **Missing**: Environment variable configuration for API endpoints

### Safest Solution Architecture

**REMOVE the proxy dependency entirely** and use direct API calls:

1. **Why CoinGecko Direct Calls Are Safe**:
   - ‚úÖ CoinGecko public API supports CORS (designed for browser use)
   - ‚úÖ No API key required for basic tier
   - ‚úÖ Works identically in dev, preview, and production
   - ‚úÖ No hidden complexity or dev-only magic
   - ‚úÖ Transparent and predictable behavior

2. **Environment-Based Configuration**:
   - Use Vite's built-in env variables (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`)
   - Same code works everywhere
   - Easy to switch between test/production APIs if needed
   - Industry standard best practice

3. **Security Benefits**:
   - No reliance on dev-only tooling in production
   - Consistent behavior across all environments
   - Follows Vite security best practices
   - Easier to audit and debug

## High-level Task Breakdown

## Lessons

### Architecture & Security Lessons ‚≠ê CRITICAL
- **NEVER rely on Vite's `server.proxy` for anything other than local development convenience**
  - Proxy is dev-only tooling, not meant for production (Vite security best practices)
  - Creates environment-specific behavior that leads to bugs
  - Makes app untestable in production-like environments (preview mode)
- **ALWAYS use environment variables for API configuration**
  - Use `VITE_*` prefixed env vars for Vite apps
  - Same code should work in dev, preview, and production
  - Makes deployment safer and more flexible
- **Public APIs with CORS support should be called directly from frontend**
  - CoinGecko API supports CORS for browser calls
  - Direct calls are simpler, safer, and more transparent than proxies
  - Only use backend proxy when necessary (API keys, rate limiting, etc.)

### API & Build Lessons
- A `429 Too Many Requests` error from an API can manifest as a CORS error in the browser
- `npm run build` is for creating a production build. `pnpm dev` (or `npm run dev`) must be used to run the local development server and see changes live
- Never trust API data to always contain expected properties - always use optional chaining and null checks
- **If dev mode works but preview mode doesn't, you're likely using dev-only features (like proxy)**

### Code Quality Lessons  
- Always add defensive null/undefined checks when accessing API response properties
- Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) for safer property access
- Components that depend on API data should have loading, error, and empty states
- TypeScript compilation success does NOT guarantee runtime safety with external data
- **"Working in dev" is not sufficient - must work consistently across all environments**

### Testing Lessons
- Test both development mode (`pnpm dev`) and preview mode (`pnpm preview`)
- Preview mode is closest to production environment - if it fails there, it will fail in prod
- Verify error states by testing with failed/empty API responses
- Build success ‚â† runtime success - always test in the browser after building
- **Use network throttling and offline mode in DevTools to test error handling**

### Documentation Best Practices ‚≠ê
- **Separate user-facing documentation from technical deployment guides**
  - README.md: Project overview, features, quick start, basic usage
  - DEPLOYMENT.md: Platform-specific deployment instructions, configuration details
  - CONTRIBUTING.md: Guidelines for contributors (when applicable)
- Keep README.md concise and welcoming to new users
- Include badges, emojis, and clear sections for better readability
- Always provide example environment variables and configuration
- Link to additional documentation from README for deeper topics

### Chart.js Plugin Management ‚≠ê
- **ALWAYS import and register plugins explicitly when using advanced features**
  - Filler plugin required for `fill: true` option in datasets
  - TimeScale plugin needed for time-based charts
  - Other plugins may be required for specific chart types or features
- **Import plugins from 'chart.js' package, not from separate packages**
  ```typescript
  import {
    Chart as ChartJS,
    CategoryScale,
    LinearScale,
    Filler, // Required for fill: true
    TimeScale, // Required for time charts
    // ... other plugins
  } from 'chart.js';
  ```
- **Register plugins immediately after import**
  ```typescript
  ChartJS.register(CategoryScale, LinearScale, Filler, TimeScale);
  ```
- **Chart.js warnings indicate missing plugins - always fix these to prevent runtime issues**
- **Test charts after adding new plugins to ensure they work correctly**
