# Project Plan: Crypto Analysis Dashboard

This document outlines the development plan for the Crypto Analysis Dashboard, based on initial ideas.

## Background and Motivation

The goal is to build a comprehensive crypto analysis dashboard. The initial version can fetch data, but we need to expand its capabilities to provide more immediate value to the user, introduce personalization, and leverage AI for unique insights.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

- Integrating multiple data sources (market data, on-chain data).
- Implementing and visualizing technical analysis indicators.
- Developing a secure and scalable user account system.
- Leveraging LLMs for insightful data analysis.
- Designing a sustainable SaaS model.

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Enhance Core Data Features

- **Trending Coins:** Implement a feature to display the top trending cryptocurrencies. This should be added in the `dashboard` portal As a bigger cell than current cell, Showing some of the current most trending coins.
- **Gainers & Losers:** Add a section to show the top crypto gainers and losers over the last 24 hours. This should be added in the `dashboard` portal As a cell, Showing some of the current most Gainers & Losers coins.

- **Customizable Watchlist:** Allow users to create and save a personal watchlist. This should be added in the `Portfolio` portal As several cells.
